Wovie: Redux

I've changed the formatting for version:

0.0.0 (Major reworks . New features . bug fixes)

Patch notes for 3.3.3 (completed features only):

- Fixed Recently Added Series home module to not show anime
- Fixed Movies/Series/Episodes/Actors Titles/Names to use Arabic

- Added Serie tags to Episode page
- Added Arabic Translation (thanks to @MEGZ99 and @kingaliyt for the translations) even though it's not 100% translated, it's translated enough
  - still need to work on script to work with right to left languages though

- Changed the Admin menu to be a bit easier
  - Under Content Movies is on top, then Series, then Slider and everything below it is Alphabetical
  - Under Community Users is on top and everything below it is Alphabetical
  - Under Settings General is on top and everything below it is Alphabetical
- Changed Collections Page to only show admin collections
  - Users can still have collections but they will only show up on their profile pages

*To Do:
- Fix on the movie/serie/episode pages the link to genres doesn't actually work it just goes to the movies or series page but doesn't apply the genre
- Fix when admin/user uses a rtl that the script actually shows rtl and not ltr
- Fix search to recognize non-roman/latin lettering
